The URL for the API is: "http://flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:8050/all/" (YOU MUST BE LOGGED ONTO THE OSU VPN).

To search for park specific use the URL: "http://flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:8050/search/:park/" where you replace the term "park" with the name of the park in interest.

For a more client side friendly search, visit: http://flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:8050/parksAPI.html.
